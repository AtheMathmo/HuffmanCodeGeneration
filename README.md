# Huffman Code Generation

_This is an old project which I am no longer working on._

This is a simple java applet which allows huffman code generation. 

You input a piece of sample text to be encoded, as well as the base for your encoded alphabet (2 for binary, 3 for ternary, etc.). The program evaluates the input string and returns an optimal encoding for the input text.

This work was constructed as an introduction to Huffman Codes following my Coding and Cryptography course at the University of Cambridge.
